## Language modeling

This repository demonstrates two different approaches to a language model, and how word classes can be included.

An example of a context free grammar with word classes can be found here:

* cfg_word_classes

An example of a statistical language model with word classes can be found here:

* slm_word_classes

Documentation which was used to generate these examples can be found in the "report" folder.

Additionally, an example of a minimalistic grammar can be found here:

* mg_technology_preview
